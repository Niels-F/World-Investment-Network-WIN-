# World Investment Network (WIN)
This project aims to study bilateral investments with the help of complex network analysis. First, using the FINFLOWS database, we will construct the World Investment Network (WIN): countries will be the nodes of the WIN, and a directed weighted link will exist between nodes A and B if the corresponding country A invests in country B. The weight of the link will be proportional to the invested amount of money. Using the PageRank (CheiRank) algorithm, we will rank the countries according to their capabilities to attract investments (to invest) from (to) other countries. The PageRank/CheiRank analysis will allow us to place the countries in an Investor/Fundraiser plane and determine the efficiency of the countriesâ€™ foreign investment policies. The WIN structure will also be analyzed using other centrality measures, cluster analysis methods, and opinion formation models.
